      About
      <hr/>
      <p>I started SimpleFood.io after looking for a recipe online at the beginning of a staycation. I just want the recipe. No, I don't want to read your blog. No, I don't want to sort through a pile of ads and opinion pieces to find the cooking temperature. No, I don't want the instructions on a different page from the ingredients list. Give me the damn recipe.</p>
      <p>I want to make cooking good food easy and fast. Also, if I didn't write my recipes down here I would lose them.</p>
      <p>I started this project looking at all the slick new hotness static react page generators that boasted the latest techniques in pre-loading and blah, blah, blah. I realized I didn't need all those fancy tools. No, all I needed was a few javascript files and a weekend of interpolating strings. </p>
